### <center>**`Read` carefully which is asking to do in this class otherwise code may get stop be sure that when it is asking for true and false then input must be in true and false only `without spelling mistake` and this site is `case sensitive too`**.
### <center>**When you are asking for categories and subcategories to choose from the option they give then let say you give wrong spell then code would not stop it just ask again you to write that word again but when it is asking for product id/number then you have to give one among them**.
### <center>**If you are following what asking then this site will not create any type of problem it is very handy to use, but the main thing is you have to follow the message that interacts with you when you run `TestMain` class**.
